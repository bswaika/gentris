# GenTris
#### **Senior Year Undergraduate Dissertation**

A Tetris game playing agent based on **Genetic Algorithms**. The game was built from scratch on **Electron** which is a cross platform desktop application framework on top of Javascript. The application also hosts a visualisation dashboard to show the performance of evolution of the agent over different generations. It was created as a final year project in undergrad and contains the dissertation submitted in `/dissertation/dissertation-final-year.pdf`. A full description of the literature, methodology and results have been described in that document.
